The coconut is subtle, the half-n-half adds a foamy head but without becoming unctuous. Sweet pineapple juice is the dominant note, the rum and cachaca don't stand out (I wonder if using the cachaca helps the booze hide behind the pineapple.) Excellent for pineapple fans."

For me, the Bison Grass Vodka flavour predominates - and not in a positive way. However, all flavours are subjective! I assume omitting the lime makes for a slightly sweeter drink. The colour is grey - a factual and rather classy colour that gives no hint of the inherent flavour. Certainly an intriguing combo of flavours, and if folks like Bison Grass it's a possible winner."

The generous amount of Angostura has its good reason. Because of the Grenadine I held back with the sugar syrup just a tad, turned out perfect. Absolute killer."

A 3-rum blend really gives this drink proper character (but I hold to 2 oz of rum total, so I don’t end up under the table).

My personal preference is 1 oz Plantation Grande Reserve (or 3-Star), 1/2 oz Smith & Cross, and 1/2 oz El Dorado 12 year. And yes - I love to load it up unreasonably with Angostura!"

Seale 10-year-old (though I now think white rum would work better), 1 oz Carpano Antica formula, and 3/4 oz Martini & Rossi Riserva Speciale Bitter, which is a bit less quinine-dominated than Campari. Used a really big orange twist and dropped it in since no orange wheels. Not sure that the Xocolatl bitters are helping; this has plenty going on as it is. The real question is whether/which rum works as a base for a Negroni."

So we upped the tequila to 50ml and the bitter liqueur and lemon juice each to 12.5ml. One of our rules is that the sweet must always serve the sour, not the other way around; so we dialled back the sweet to 10ml (7.5ml sugar syrup and 2.5ml natural rose essence). It's a bold Margarita and who could possibly complain about that?"

Overproof rum has its valour, but to add refined sugar or any sort or ice without asking deserves a proper slap on the wrists. I would never dare serve such a drink. JMHO"

Could maybe try a small amount of sugar syrup if you want something more on the dessert side of things, but either way, a fairly well balanced easy sipper."

Every time I use Rose's Lime Juice I get this lingering industrial bitterness that's not the kind of bitter we intentionally add to our beverages. whilst checking the internet for a substitute, came across a recipe at jeffreymorgenthaler.com. His uses sugar, lime juice, lime zest and citric acid. Great comments also."

I made this with Campari, Pallini, and fresh blood orange and it feels like a good balance of bittersweet. Sweet at first, then Campari herbal orange bitterness, which then fades and mellows out to a nice mild bittersweetness with subtle lemon and blood orange leaving you wanting another sip."

Added 1 dash Peychaud's but no saline (hey, we weren't putting it in our EYES). A bit tart; might increase the pomegranate liqueur to 1/3 or 1/2 oz. This belongs in the \"Big Easy\" section of the drink book."

This is actually a very good recipe here; I opted for 10 ml grenadine instead of a sugar split. My recipe also uses bonded rye, but I employ an 8:4:3:2 ratio. Much respect to this version though... Maybe my memory is hazy, but the bar in which I worked where I first tried this used a footed rocks glass (which I still use at home for it), but I swear it also had egg white in it. Love it like that too."

Definitely needs less bitter red than a bourbon Boulevardier so stuck with 4:2:1 proportions rather than 4:3:2.

Designed to be sour enough to drink slowly, but the vodka flavour should not be prevalent.\nYou need to use good vodka as the cheap stuff with give the cocktail an off taste.\nThe same goes for the cranberry juice. It should be strong of flavour and not watered down. I used an unsweetened organic cranberry and add my own sugar. Some of the premixed juice can be big on sugar and short on taste."

It's simple to make - if you are stuck for grapefruit juice, a fresh fruit will yield ~150ml with very little effort. All positives, and it's no wonder it was so popular. May feel overly diluted to some taste buds, and it's really hard to resist skipping the shake and just building this simple concoction in the glass over ice."

This recipe I will have to research more, given it's history and the ingredients... Best thing I came up with now is: 45 ml cold brew coffee, 30 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca, 20 ml Irish cream, 15 ml coffee liqueur (Borghetti)... Tried my specs with Cognac; interesting, but wouldn't recommend... Interested to hear of your findings."

Also, there wasn’t enough grenadine to turn it red - just vaguely pink. I reshook with 1/2 oz grenadine instead of a mix of grenadine and rich simple syrup, and reduced the Wray to 1 oz. Better, still not right though. I think it’s because the original recipe calls for a 151 dark rum, rather than Wray overproof.\n\nWon’t make again."

Since it is getting to be Fall season here, I went with a local, fresh pressed apple cider instead of a commercial apple juice (apple cider is basically raw, unfiltered, unpasteurized apple juice). The apple flavor was very prominent and less sweet (most commercial apple juices have extra sugars added). If you use apple cider, double straining may be required if you want a \"cleaner\" cocktail due the extra apple pulp present in apple cider. I liked it with it present."

The fruit balances the bitterness of the Negroni; use your preferred Negroni proportions. With muddled fruit I just shake rather than stir, and I strain as usual; fine straining is overly fussy for a drink that ain't a martini to begin with. This is a template that can be used with other fruits and with White Negronis as well, e.g., a White Peach Negroni. Experiment to match ingredient brands/styles to fruits."

Nonetheless, this is going into my catalog. (24 Jun 2023, 10:06a)"

The Mezcal added a smokey touch and, though I could not detect the pear flavour specifically, it was there reinforcing the other flavours. It might be nice to experiment with 20 ml Poire William, if folks want a more forward pear taste. The mixologist was impressed with the concoction, too!"

The flavors are really well balanced though, you can taste the agave spirits without any edge, but my indifference towards tequila prevents me from appreciating that balance too much. I think this would actually be fantastic in a highball though, it hits that boozy + refreshing + slightly sweet spot that benefits from some crisp carbonation. Will report back after I try it."

The better you can afford the more reward you will have."

Made with a 50/50 mix of Wild Turkey 101 & 81 bourbon, Wild Turkey 101 Rye, Licor 43, Liber & Co Almond Orgeat, Disaronno, & Bittermens Xocolatl Mole bitters."

Immediately wanted to tweak the specs until I let it pass over my palate a few times and mindfully observed the flavor changes. Used a bottled-in-bond bourbon in addition to a similar rye. Would prefer to have used a more quality amaretto... All of the drink's core components stand out. Really not necessary to adjust measurements. Kind of impressed. (22 Jan 2023, 2:07p)"

Left the gin at 1.75 oz for a \"dry Negroni\" effect. Cynar instead of Campari is a great variation, and the proportions make for a lighter, drier cocktail that lets the herbal aspects of the ingredients come through rather than being overwhelmed by sweet and bitter flavors.

I liked it better on the rocks, giving a bit of dilution (as written, this cocktail yeilds a higher ABV result than a typical whiskey old-fashioned). You'll need to know your guests before springing this on them, as many may not appreciate the high proof. Again, it is delicious - the Nonino flavor notes display very nicely with the spice of the rye. I think other high proof amari would be interesting to experiement with."

I garnished with a big lemon zest this time and think it works better than orange, which doesn't otherwise appear in this drink."

Good very tasty, but I’m missing a cocktail taste. I tried the watermelon martini as prescribed but found it a bit tart. And slightly artificial.

The Waldorf Astoria Cocktail book has a great recipe - combine and heat 12 oz pomegranate juice, 12 oz of brown sugar, and the peels from two oranges. Heat just long enough to bring to a boil and immediately take off the burner. Let ingredient steep for 3-5 min and strain. Bottle in a sterile jar with a splash of everclear to keep for a little longer in the fridge. Keeps up to a month. Do that and give this drink another go ;)"

As a result, I would recommend serving this drink with a small straw so that people taste the minty part of the drink first."

That’s not dry!"

For example, if a recipe states 10ml (1/3oz) of 2:1 rich sugar syrup, then the equivalent in 1:1 simple syrup is just 15ml (½oz), not 20ml, as you might expect. I have experimented with Embury’s 3:1 syrup, and it is too thick to pour out of a measure without leaving an unknown percentage in the jigger. It also tends to crystallise."

I don’t have all the bartender gear so judging three dashes is difficult to balance the cocktail. We enjoyed it, but it’s not going to be in our top favourites. It’s very pleasant, balanced not sweet or dry, can just about make out the grand marnier behind the absinthe. Gin and vermouth seem to play a “dilution” role primarily for the absinthe."

Reducing Craddock's proportion of gin to half that of cognac leaves the gin flavors present but not dominant. Decided to use pomegranate molasses rather than grenadine, which gave the drink more weight. The tiny trace of absinthe (I tried measuring \"1 dash\" since my bottle doesn't have a shaker top) was not detectable. Can't believe I'm the first to comment on this drink!"

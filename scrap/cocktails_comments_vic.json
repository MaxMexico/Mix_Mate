The drink works incredibly well, with so much wonderful balanced fruitiness and sweetness, off-set by the botanicals of the gin adding backbone and balance. Not mind-blowing, definitely worthy of the 4 stars, maybe nudging to 4.25?"

Although my grenadine is not a vivid as commercial syrup there is only 15/110 ml of red ingredients here so I think there is a mistake with the picture. That said, the drink was lovely: light, creamy, mild gin. The 5 & 5 scores are bang on. Will certainly be having this one again."

Go for a young rum, the indication here of 6-8 years is pretty good. And I recommend, really try it with the Havana Club 7 anos. Dave Brooms's recommends it for mixing with ginger beer in \"Rum. The Manual\" and he es right."

The next time I try it I'll try reducing the mezcal a touch, as it is more domineering than I'd like, but perhaps by not as much as 15mls. Maybe another couple of dashes of absinthe, too."

It is light and sweet, with enough bitterness to suit an aperitivo. It Is colorful and easy to replicate.

I don't know if it's as effective as the foil, but it seemed to work. My snifter was also too big for the lid, so some smoke may have escaped... Like John suggested, the drink stands on its own without the smoke, but the smoke definitely adds a pleasant perfumy accent."

Here is my trick for the cinnamon smoke: place the powder on a small piece of aluminum foil, put the glass upside down over the cinnamon, and wrap the foil tightly around the glass. Then lift the glass, the foil with the cinnamon down, and heat the foil for a few seconds with a kitchen burner (like for cr√®me br√ªl√©e). Thus, the cinnamon doesn‚Äôt fly away und the smoke is trapped in the glass until the liquid is mixed. Remove the glass, cover it with something‚Ä¶"

At that point, it's a good - not great - cocktail. But all the same, an interesting one to try if only for it's eclectic composition."

The remark about this cocktail potentially having a 'misleading' name is definitely true, for, like other user-submitted comments here, the banana element is actually quite subtle. Might work much better holistically if my expectations of this drink was that it was an aperitif, rather than, as the name suggests, some kind of dessert/digestif. Will try again with 30ml Tempus Fugit though."

For me, this is a definite improvement as I am quite fond of banana, but at this ratio you start to get some of the underlying silverey mouthfeel of the liqueur which some people may not like, and may be somewhat un-daiquiri-esque.

I personally was not hoping for a banana-forward/sweet banana drink here; I love the plain Daiquiri and definitely wanted a Daiquiri first with banana undertones second, but the banana here was barely (if at all) detectable.\n\nFor me increasing the Banane du Bresil from 2/3oz/20ml to 1oz/30ml did the trick. I personally think with this the drink is identifiably and very pleasantly banana-tasting but without overwhelming the core of the Daiquiri or becoming very sweet.\n\nThe Giffard Banane du Bresil is magnificent (it actually smells and tastes richly of bananas, not artificial banana-sweet flavour) but I wonder if the proportion suggested is more suitable for lower grade/artificially flavoured and bright yellow banana liqueurs which I suspect might be more prone to overpowering the lovely rum and citrus? I have some Bols Banana liqueur lying around (very potent 'foam banana sweet' smell/taste) and should endeavour to test this theory."

L'Aero D'Or sounds like it has more orange-y flavors so I upped the Curacao to 1 tsp and used Angostura Orange bitters. Not too sweet and plenty of interesting flavors going on. My wife agrees that this one is a winner."

This was a great drink regardless, with a distinct evolution from bitter grapefruit to herbal tequila to sherry salinity. It's complex and well balanced and overall delightful."

Here I am, another spring, another Bending Blades... and now I can't imagine it without that Suzean slap. So I'm definitely sticking to the original 15ml, but I hope others will try it either way and add another favourite cocktail to their cabinets!"

Cynar is popular right now, but it's the wrong Amaro for this balance. Averna is much better. And as for a garnish, I'm partial to an orange twist, which brings in a citrus bitter that adds so much more than cherry sweetness. So, my recipe is: 2 oz rye, 1 oz Cocchi Americano, 1/3 oz (2 tsp) Maraschino Liqueur, 1/6 oz (1 tsp) Averna. Stir, orange twist."

Used Elixir's Ver green herbal liqueur (Oregon's finest) instead of Chartreuse and it was more than sufficiently complex and bitter. A lemon twist played to the herbal aspects probably better than orange, and there isn't orange in this version of the Bijou anyway. To be savored slowly, as the ice melts."

Really lets the Jager notes shine without being too overwhelming (I haven't had a lot of Jager yet, but this one really made the 'cola' notes noticeable). Less than 1 standard drink, too, so a nice, interesting option if looking for something that's not too strong."

I did, however, then try this with 60 ml of Junipero Gin, and it's better, but I'm still contemplating a blend, only to knock down the intense herbal notes of the Junipero and Noilly Prat dry... Why is the Martini so bland yet so fascinating? (6 Oct 2022, 3:36p)"

The reduced cream of coconut is what attracted me to this recipe, because I used homemade cream of coconut, and the process of making my own let me know exactly how much sugar is in that stuff. The result was very pleasant. Of course, the most important quality of any blue curacao drink is that it should be blue, but this one is also pretty tasty. It packs a little bit of a punch though, with 45ml of rum and 40ml blue curacao."

The orange twist introduces a fresh fruity nose. The Bourbon then comes through, tempered by sweetness and botanicals of the bitters. Fantastic drink.

I think I‚Äôve nailed the recipe to my taste. When I saw this version, I was intrigued. Now that I have made it, I think it‚Äôs a very good drink. I tweaked the recipe somewhat to match my formula for the CR2. I used Cocchi Americano instead of the Lillet Blanc, and three sprays of the absinthe. Muy delicioso, y peligroso!"

As is my style, I started experimenting before the cocktail was actually consumed. Inspired by Kris Byers' reference to margaritas, I started thinking. Margaritas come in infinite varieties -- just add a flavor. So Cadaver Reviver #2 had the addition of 1/2 shot of Whidbey Island Distillery's Loganberry Liquor. Thumbs up (to the cocktail and Whidbey Island Distillery)."

In the original recipe the Riesling replaces the vermouth, and the proportions served in Rome in the 1950s was: 3 parts dry gin, 2 parts Mosel Riesling, 1 part Campari. Doing a bit of research on Mosel wine production in the 1950s, it is very likely the wine was dry. With the technology available at the time, most wines would end up dry by default, as the sugars would continue the fermentation process until there was no or very little sugar left."

(Supposedly the Selvarey White was created by the former Director of Research and Development of the Cuban rum industry overseeing Havana Club prior to 1994)). The rum was not lost for me, and I could taste each component with them all very well-balanced. Probably one of my favorite pineapple drinks so far with the Falernum really making things interesting."

In terms of profile the nose was still very much single malt whisky, but the taste and flavour in combination with the other ingredients was very similar to a Reposado. I would certainly make it again."

My version, tonight, was more like a Motel 6. I used brandy instead of cognac, marsala instead of port, homemade creme de cacao & perhaps the biggest downfall, yoghurt instead of cream (I was working with what we had). It was a strange pink colour & not quite right tho that was probs my fault."

I may try upping the lime a bit or reducing some of the sweet elements, but retain the cherry flavour. Would definitely make again."

Patron Silver is great but silver tequila is very agave-driven while this drink calls for more refinement.

Local raw, unfiltered apple juice or cider is important, and a wee bit more lemon juice helps cut the sweetness, too. Very good and distinctive!"

The Becherovka gives a great clove and winter spice touch, and the sloe gin gives it some red berry sweetness.

The cocktail starts as bright red - great for Christmas - but the Carpano Antica darkens and gives a brownish hue (too bad, but the flavors work very well)."

Nux is the first taste, but is immediately joined by the fruity cognac and PX sherry, and the Mandarin adding some fruit (plus I think it adds a bit of bitterness that I thought detracted a bit). As suggested by previous reviewers, I added a drop of chocolate bitters - IDK what difference it made, but the overall cocktail was very good and a great idea for the fall/winter season."

I guessed that a serving is 4 oz and it‚Äôs about 0.4 - 0.5 of vodka for each portion which barely qualifies as a cocktail. I was just curious what the rationale was for such little alcohol content. Perhaps a typo in the recipe? Or maybe there are some general guiding principles about alcohol proportions in punches that I am not educated about.

I attempted this with an organic seedless low-sugar jam (only had 7g of cane sugar), which was quite tart but light tasting. Could have used a barspoon of simple, probably. The pectin also makes dissolving the jam difficult - though a homemade non-pectin jam would likely be over-sweet from all the added sugar to macerate into jam."

Went with Appleton Estates 12 yr rum ( since the 12 is aged in ex-Bourbon barrels), used a local Bourbon that was very oak forward (Fiddler Georgia Heartwood) and used Grand Marnier as recommended by John. Definitely became more complex. The oakiness of the bourbon and rum really played well off each other, the citrus was also prominent and the slight amount of simple syrup really balanced it. Really enjoyed the new combination."

It‚Äô even more so for the Creole Cosmo as the shrubb might be quite different from one place/producer to another. In my first version of this cocktail, I used the Clement Canne Bleue Edition 2017 and the Karukera (Longueteau) shrubb orange liqueur. The result was too sour, nearly acidic to my taste. In my second version, I added 2.5 ml sugar cane sirup. The result was far much better."

There is a slight olive and garlic hints, but does not overpower the cocktail.\nWill definitely be trying other martini recipes and add the Olive Bitters."

On the other hand, it's not very interesting, and is dangerously easy to drink. The pineapple really dominates, such that it tastes like you're drinking pineapple juice with a splash of rum, and the rum is so hidden that it tastes more like a gulper than a sipper. I can easily see someone drinking several of these in an hour and then wondering what hit them."

Not that I can easily reproduce the diluted balance. But this blend begged for olive brine... This be my Dirty Martini template going forward."

Using 10 tea bags is quite a lot - you can always add more and adjust as you go, and not so much the other way around (unless you have more bottles of gin around to water it down! Alternatively, you can always cut open the tea bags if you really want to get exacting with it - even then, 4 tablespoons of tea to steep for 2 hours (and up to 8 hours) will do it!"

You could squeeze every last drop of gin from tea bag, but a warning that you'll over-extract tannins and bitterness doing this. Just make sure you add a tiny splash more gin for your infusion at the start to avoid this (or just do larger servings)."

No pineapple syrup so, following Morgan and Hinojos, I used 1 tsp mango puree, figuring it was closer in flavor to pineapple than passion fruit.

The gin really carries this, with the herbal and floral notes giving it a bright pop and roundness. Not too sweet."

A tad sweet but very good mix of warm flavors; benefits from the extra dilution obtained by serving over ice."

It was a very nice amari blend I'll certainly try again in the future, this batch of OJ is nicely flavoured, and I like pineapple...but the drink does not come together at all.

Orange, lemon, and syrup balance everything perfectly.\nHowever, it's challenging to stay consistent because the amount of pepper is small and a little deviation can make spice disappear or overpower the drink. That's the only issue I had with the cocktail, so try it but beware that it might take a few tries with your pepper to perfect."

The tea shouldn't be overly strong and tannic, but just nice.\nAlternatively, I found that the often recommended grated nutmeg doesn't work well for this recipe so it shouldn't be added. If you substitute lemon and simple for an equal amount of lemon sherbet, you get a sweeter softer version of the drink and the nutmeg starts making sense again. But sherbet or no sherbet; this is an awesome, light, contemporary version of this punch."

I recommend starting with one or two drops of this rosewater as it is really powerful, and adding more to personal taste, if necessary. It may be that Fiorente elderflower has a stronger taste than St. Germain, so possibly add 5 mls extra of the latter. I reckon this is a beautifully subtle and delicately floral martini if the proportions are carefully prepared; different brands can make a difference."

It doesn't have the gin+fizz backbone, because the cognac and calvados (and the absinthe) are far more prominent. Don't get me wrong, this is the best sparkling wine cocktail I've had - but I don't think it's much of a French 75."

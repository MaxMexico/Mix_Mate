Used some grated dark Swiss chocolate by Villars in Fribourg, though we normally do not have lokum on hand. Will try to get some for the next take!

Go for a young rum, the indication here of 6-8 years is pretty good. And I recommend, really try it with the Havana Club 7 anos. Dave Brooms's recommends it for mixing with ginger beer in \"Rum.

I don't know if it's as effective as the foil, but it seemed to work. My snifter was also too big for the lid, so some smoke may have escaped... Like John suggested, the drink stands on its own without the smoke, but the smoke definitely adds a pleasant perfumy accent."

This is what gives the Canadian gin Empress 1908 its indigo hue and which changes colour depending on the pH of other cocktail ingredients.)"

I may also up the amount of Luxardo cherry syrup by just a tiny touch next time as well (maybe 2 barspoons). In this way, it is a bit reminiscent of Morgenthaler's Amaretto Sour."

If you like them (or haven't tasted one and would like to), drink this -- this is a Bakewell tart in alcoholic, liquid form. Normally very dubious of 'transcriptions' of other foods, I found this one delicious and very more-ish. One note of caution: consider make it slightly light on the lemon and then testing. Maybe it's just a seasonal thing, but I'm finding the lemons very sharp at the moment."

The remark about this cocktail potentially having a 'misleading' name is definitely true, for, like other user-submitted comments here, the banana element is actually quite subtle. Might work much better holistically if my expectations of this drink was that it was an aperitif, rather than, as the name suggests, some kind of dessert/digestif. Will try again with 30ml Tempus Fugit though."

For me, this is a definite improvement as I am quite fond of banana, but at this ratio you start to get some of the underlying silverey mouthfeel of the liqueur which some people may not like, and may be somewhat un-daiquiri-esque.

I personally was not hoping for a banana-forward/sweet banana drink here; I love the plain Daiquiri and definitely wanted a Daiquiri first with banana undertones second, but the banana here was barely (if at all) detectable.\n\nFor me increasing the Banane du Bresil from 2/3oz/20ml to 1oz/30ml did the trick. I personally think with this the drink is identifiably and very pleasantly banana-tasting but without overwhelming the core of the Daiquiri or becoming very sweet.\n\nThe Giffard Banane du Bresil is magnificent (it actually smells and tastes richly of bananas, not artificial banana-sweet flavour) but I wonder if the proportion suggested is more suitable for lower grade/artificially flavoured and bright yellow banana liqueurs which I suspect might be more prone to overpowering the lovely rum and citrus? I have some Bols Banana liqueur lying around (very potent 'foam banana sweet' smell/taste) and should endeavour to test this theory."

L'Aero D'Or sounds like it has more orange-y flavors so I upped the Curacao to 1 tsp and used Angostura Orange bitters. Not too sweet and plenty of interesting flavors going on. My wife agrees that this one is a winner."

Being a bit complicated, I settled for a Kir and proposed to make this Bellini later on. I didn\u2019t get the fluffiness I wanted, although I used egg white, but very nice all the same.

Cynar is popular right now, but it's the wrong Amaro for this balance. Averna is much better. And as for a garnish, I'm partial to an orange twist, which brings in a citrus bitter that adds so much more than cherry sweetness. So, my recipe is: 2 oz rye, 1 oz Cocchi Americano, 1/3 oz (2 tsp) Maraschino Liqueur, 1/6 oz (1 tsp) Averna. Stir, orange twist."

Used Elixir's Ver green herbal liqueur (Oregon's finest) instead of Chartreuse and it was more than sufficiently complex and bitter. A lemon twist played to the herbal aspects probably better than orange, and there isn't orange in this version of the Bijou anyway. To be savored slowly, as the ice melts."

I think the lime can also be rised to 40 rather than 30, I believe much of the pleasure comes from the sweetness of the whole egg (like egg cakes, really) and the explosive tartness of the lime.I wonder if, indeed, one might substitute the lime for an even tarter lime cordial"

The cocktail gains a fresher fruit flavour and at the same time a character that is somewhat lacking in the usual Havana 7y. The cocktail has gone from a i try and liked to a favorite."

It packs a little bit of a punch though, with 45ml of rum and 40ml blue curacao."

Every element, from the esters of the rum (I used Havana Club 3), the fruitiness, woodiness and grape-y nature of the Cognac, along with the citrus sweetness of the orange, plus tartness of the lime (with the exception of aquafaba in place of egg white, which merely contributed the foam) came through so wonderfully. I'd give this a 4.5, personally."

In the 2:1:1 I have to say Eugene has hit the nail on the head as the bourbon does indeed define the drink. In all honesty I found it to be a nicely balanced bourbon forward drink where the vermouth and the red bitter liqueur act more like exotic bitters than as negroni ingredients. For me I prefer the original equal parts but there's no denying the balance in the 2:1:1 is sublime."

I wouldn\u2019t be worried about over-diluting it as long as you use a lot of \u201cfresh\u201d ice ;) Of course you can drink it the way you like and try it on block.

Thumbs up (to the cocktail and Whidbey Island Distillery)."

The Dewar's version was ok, but overpowered by the orgeat. And I'm not sure why one would blend blended Scotch and Irish whiskey. The Ardbeg, however, brought out much more flavor nuances, most notably conjuring roasty and nutty flavors from the orgeat... What is meant by 'Scotch' in 1930? I must investigate."

In the original recipe the Riesling replaces the vermouth, and the proportions served in Rome in the 1950s was: 3 parts dry gin, 2 parts Mosel Riesling, 1 part Campari. Doing a bit of research on Mosel wine production in the 1950s, it is very likely the wine was dry. With the technology available at the time, most wines would end up dry by default, as the sugars would continue the fermentation process until there was no or very little sugar left."

(Supposedly the Selvarey White was created by the former Director of Research and Development of the Cuban rum industry overseeing Havana Club prior to 1994)).

Your body absorbs the natural electrolytes from coconut water faster than anything else out their, it plays with the idea of if you\u2019re going to drink and dehydrate yourself, might as well have a mixer which is phenomenal for hydration lol"

I used brandy instead of cognac, marsala instead of port, homemade creme de cacao & perhaps the biggest downfall, yoghurt instead of cream (I was working with what we had).

There are some variables in this which could impact the sweetness: The sweetness of the rum and the cherries.

I may try upping the lime a bit or reducing some of the sweet elements, but retain the cherry flavour. Would definitely make again."

I was just curious what the rationale was for such little alcohol content. Perhaps a typo in the recipe?

The Campari balance is good as is at 1/4 oz since it's mixed with elderflower rather than sweet vermouth. I served it in coupes to distribute the citrus oils over a larger surface area for more nose and to eliminate the big ice cube just below the surface. The citrus oils are an important part of what makes this a great cocktail."

Not just slightly sweet; really cloying when made 1:1:1 with Abasolo/Nixta/Cocchi Americano; and I'm not someone who is averse to sweet cocktails in general. I re-made it yesterday with 2:1:1 proportions and this was much nicer, though even still I thought could do with a bit more whisky."

I zero the scales with the container and then built on the weight, adding the weight of each successive ingredient."

Dropped it to 1/2 oz second time, and now the gin and lemon jump out. Not sure which one I prefer... Regardless, one of my favorite combination of flavors in a drink."

I attempted this with an organic seedless low-sugar jam (only had 7g of cane sugar), which was quite tart but light tasting. Could have used a barspoon of simple, probably. The pectin also makes dissolving the jam difficult - though a homemade non-pectin jam would likely be over-sweet from all the added sugar to macerate into jam."

Definitely became more complex. The oakiness of the bourbon and rum really played well off each other, the citrus was also prominent and the slight amount of simple syrup really balanced it.

Still a tad sweet, will probably cut the Benedictine a bit next time. Excellent mix, esp. if you like Brooklyns, but is it Big Apple or Big Easy?"

It\u2019 even more so for the Creole Cosmo as the shrubb might be quite different from one place/producer to another. In my first version of this cocktail, I used the Clement Canne Bleue Edition 2017 and the Karukera (Longueteau) shrubb orange liqueur. The result was too sour, nearly acidic to my taste. In my second version, I added 2.5 ml sugar cane sirup. The result was far much better."

Definitely on the boozy side, especially on the finish, but the Benedictine brings a nice contrast throughout. I found the apple to be a bit muted, so I might switch to 1 Oz Irish whiskey and 1 Oz Calvados if I make this again."

First time making this, the basil wasn't apparent, but the second time, a mere shaking in the tin would suffice, unless you like those extra-green flavors of the basil. Damn tasty drink overall and one could get away with reducing (either) the sugar and (or) Campari by a quarter measure."

I can easily see someone drinking several of these in an hour and then wondering what hit them."

You could squeeze every last drop of gin from tea bag, but a warning that you'll over-extract tannins and bitterness doing this.

No pineapple syrup so, following Morgan and Hinojos, I used 1 tsp mango puree, figuring it was closer in flavor to pineapple than passion fruit. No fresh pineapple so garnished with candied ginger on cocktail swords, which works quite well with the tropical flavors. Makes for a great, offbeat tiki drink."

I also added 2 dashes of orange bitters since I was out of fresh oranges to squeeze an orange peel. Overall, a very nice cocktail. The Sloe gin is very prevalent with a 2:1 Sloe:Dry gin version and it was very nice evening/fall cocktail"

Because of the emphasis on cherry liqueur, we avoided the further sweetening Aperol would have offered and went, instead, with Campari. So when you indicate the generic aperitivo are you leaving it to the discerning drinker to decide according to their own preferences? After all, there is a world of difference between Aperol and Campari."

The drink is mostly noted as coming from the 1946 Stork Club Bar Book, but it actually goes much further back. Non-alcoholic Egg Sours appear in some very early bar guides like O.H. Byron's. But as far as I can tell this version that includes brandy and Curacao dates at least from the 1888 Police Gazette bar guide. And it's very nice!"

The gin really carries this, with the herbal and floral notes giving it a bright pop and roundness. Not too sweet."

Used Stranahan's Rocky Mountain Cask Strength Single Malt and Carpano Classico (haven't seen Strucchi over here). A tad sweet but very good mix of warm flavors; benefits from the extra dilution obtained by serving over ice."

Could potentially even go 40 on the avallen.\nAnother delicious use for nonino apart from a paper plane!"

Individually, I love the components - el dorado 8, I tried to approximate the Nardini (a slightly more licorice and orange version of Averna?) with 3:1 Averna and a Dutch herbal bitter with strong licorice notes, and a tiny dash of Riga Balsam espresso. It was a very nice amari blend I'll certainly try again in the future, this batch of OJ is nicely flavoured, and I like pineapple...but the drink does not come together at all. I get no rum, little fruit, and bitter."

The tea shouldn't be overly strong and tannic, but just nice.\nAlternatively, I found that the often recommended grated nutmeg doesn't work well for this recipe so it shouldn't be added. If you substitute lemon and simple for an equal amount of lemon sherbet, you get a sweeter softer version of the drink and the nutmeg starts making sense again. But sherbet or no sherbet; this is an awesome, light, contemporary version of this punch."

The result felt a little \u201cflat\u201d (not bad, just a bit too one dimensional for my palate), so I added a dash of Peychaud\u2019s and one of Angostura bitters to the drink after consuming half and it really upped the flavour profile, adding a bit of herbs and heat to the final impression."

My version of the Fluffy Duck keeps all the ingredients & ratios the same except I substituted Fever Tree Blood Orange Soda which not only gives the drink an added orange zing but a lovely pale orange layer above the heavier Advocaat mix. Try it! Since mine could be considered a riff on the original I called it the Ducky Fluff :)"

The fruit juices, the acidity, and the combination of Drambuie and elderflower liqueur makes for a cocktail that acknowledges its lineage to but is differentiated from the Rusty Nail.

It's interesting because this one \"flip-flops\" the sour/sweet notes vs the Lady's Sidecar. This one starts with the sweetness of the Limoncello and finishes with more of the citrus sour tones. Very nice though."

No Pallini so used Bellini limoncello liqueur, figuring that was close enough. Lemons from Albertson\u2019s, not Amalfi. Added a couple lemon twists to the shaker and garnished with lemon zest to be sure it was lemony enough. It was. Excellent!"

I understand why you do this kind of thing, and you do it continually, but your recipes would be tried more if you offered substitutes or how-to-make-ersatz-versions of uncommon ingredients. That way, if I liked the jury-rigged version, I'd be much more likely to go for the real thing - and Giffards would sell more. As it is, this recipe prompted me to make an Old Fashioned, period."

In my case the lime citrus and rum were the predominant flavors with the apricot brandy not being noticeable."

A vaguely Martinez-like concoction, with a vegetal aftertaste and orange jelly candy backdrop. (6 Nov 2024, 1:04p)"

No curacao so used de Fussigny orange cognac liqueur, which is nice & orangey. I recently got Drillaud's Pomegranate liqueur and find it a superior alternative to grenadine since it adds richness and flavor, not just additional sugar. And I don't care if Vic called for it but the sugar syrup is completely unnecessary. No cartridge glasses so served in tiki mugs rather than Collins glasses."

It was very good, but thought it tasted a bit rough around the edges - so I added an additional serving of orange marmalade to the remainder. That balanced it nicely."

Will do this one again over the summer."

The Bourbon was more prevalent at that ratio.\nFor those commenting that it was too minty, a \"julep\" has mint as a predominant flavor. Something you can try, instead of muddling the mint leaves, is to just add them to the shaker without muddling. As you are shaking the cocktail, the ice will bruise the mint leaves just enough to give the cocktail a more subtle mint flavor."

Ice cubes would have been better, the moulds I have here are too big I must say. I used Aperol as I didn't know what to expect and if I make this again I would use Campari."

It is a bit less bitter, the orange stands out better, also the color is pink and fun. Depending on the triple sec this can be a less sweet, less bitter, more citrusy alternative to Negroni. Probably won't replace it in your repertoire but can find its way as a variation so we don't get bored."

Drain off the water, the idea is the ice should only be coated in bitters and not have any liquid bitters in the bottom, then start adding the ingredients one at a time then stir, topping up with fresh ice throughout, storing for 90 seconds before adding each ingredient. Water from the ice as you stir is essential."

Use a softer, less bold vermouth like Dolin and the whiskey comes through even stronger. Serving it up only accentuates the booziness.\n\nHence I suggest upping the vermouth, or lessening the whiskey, or both, and perhaps try it on-the-rocks (my grandfather's personal favorite drink, I know where my taste comes from!). Difford's \"High Ryeser\" recipe is more suited to my taste and works great on ice too.\n\nIf you like whiskey a lot more than you like vermouth, 2:1 is probably perfect. I love vermouth though..."

I have made this for a few dinner guests and they\u2019ve been very impressed with it. I think it has a good balance of complexity and accessibility. The only reason it\u2019s a treat cocktail is because the ingredients (Calvados, G Chartreuse) are very expensive here in Canada.\n\nIf you enjoy a Last Word, try it. If you enjoy this, the Wardays Cocktail is really nice too."

Talisker is a bit on the milder side of smoke and its more maritime qualities sat well with the gin. The addition of bianco vermouth rounded it off. I second Jason's comment you need a gin with a strong presence to balance the peat. Unbelievable how such a small amount of peat can contribute so much."

Used Plantation 3 Stars and could taste it very clearly (especially around the middle of the flavour evolution), even though I used Punt e Mes instead of a less bitter vermouth. Will definitely make again. I do agree that it's better served down with orange bitters."

White rum doesn't stand up to the red ingredients as well as gin does. Using a higher ratio of vermouth to Campari improves the Negroni when making it with Campari as the bitter red, though; I may try this with other Valentino/Negroni recipes."

You have to try this. The bitterness can be an acquired taste but you can work up starting with an Enzoni Cocktail (vermouth replaced with lemon juice, sugar and some muddled grapes) or the simplicity of a Garibaldi (orange juice + Campari).\n\nSpeaking of rum, the Jungle Bird also mixes Campari with pineapple juice, lime and dark rum."

It's more complex than a G&T, though, with the fruit notes thrown in the mix."

The Averna makes it heavier and richer and more complex than a conventional Campari-based Negroni so I garnished with lemon zest instead of orange for contrast. Very good Negroni variant."

The applejack doesn't play a leading role in the flavor, but does help keep the cocktail light and a bit fruity - preventing overwhelming aquavit flavors. And the sweet vermouth is surprisingly demure - I'm sure it helps with the sweetness and color, and the overall fruitiness, but flavor notes are far behind the lead of the aquavit and chartreuse."

I might try playing with the ratio of aquavit to brandy, and see if I can adjust them to my taste."

The coconut is subtle, the half-n-half adds a foamy head but without becoming unctuous. Sweet pineapple juice is the dominant note, the rum and cachaca don't stand out (I wonder if using the cachaca helps the booze hide behind the pineapple.) Excellent for pineapple fans."

For me, the Bison Grass Vodka flavour predominates - and not in a positive way. However, all flavours are subjective! I assume omitting the lime makes for a slightly sweeter drink. The colour is grey - a factual and rather classy colour that gives no hint of the inherent flavour. Certainly an intriguing combo of flavours, and if folks like Bison Grass it's a possible winner."

The generous amount of Angostura has its good reason. Because of the Grenadine I held back with the sugar syrup just a tad, turned out perfect. Absolute killer."

It definitely should consist of #1) a light/gold 1-3 year, #2) an overproof/navy-strength, and #3) a heavy Demerara.

Used a really big orange twist and dropped it in since no orange wheels. Not sure that the Xocolatl bitters are helping; this has plenty going on as it is. The real question is whether/which rum works as a base for a Negroni."

One of our rules is that the sweet must always serve the sour, not the other way around; so we dialled back the sweet to 10ml (7.5ml sugar syrup and 2.5ml natural rose essence). It's a bold Margarita and who could possibly complain about that?"

You need one which is not adulterated by sugar syrup.\nWhile I love the funk of Jamaican, Martinique, and Haitian rhum, it will through this cocktail off balance. Stick with Barbados."

Agreed with Andre that it needed more aged rum. Seemed to work a bit better mixing in the overproof rum to add some depth of flavour to the cocktail. Did drink the full cocktail, but there are other rum cocktails much better."

Overproof rum has its valour, but to add refined sugar or any sort or ice without asking deserves a proper slap on the wrists. I would never dare serve such a drink. JMHO"

Every time I use Rose's Lime Juice I get this lingering industrial bitterness that's not the kind of bitter we intentionally add to our beverages. whilst checking the internet for a substitute, came across a recipe at jeffreymorgenthaler.com. His uses sugar, lime juice, lime zest and citric acid. Great comments also."

I made this with Campari, Pallini, and fresh blood orange and it feels like a good balance of bittersweet. Sweet at first, then Campari herbal orange bitterness, which then fades and mellows out to a nice mild bittersweetness with subtle lemon and blood orange leaving you wanting another sip."

For an even brighter, even zingy-er taste, instead of passion fruit syrup I use the contents of @ 1/2 a fresh passion fruit - seeds and all - along a dash of simple syrup, and as this is usually ends up being rather more than 7.5ml, I adjust the amounts of everything else to keep the same ratios. I can't always be bothered crushing ice, but luckily made as a regular shaken cocktail it\u2019s still truly STELLAR!"

It should be strong of flavour and not watered down. I used an unsweetened organic cranberry and add my own sugar. Some of the premixed juice can be big on sugar and short on taste."

If you use apple cider, double straining may be required if you want a \"cleaner\" cocktail due the extra apple pulp present in apple cider. I liked it with it present."

Didn't measure 5 drops as intended. Just came out in a small stream with my finger over and then incorporated with a cocktail stick. Pepper and balsamic would seem to be underutilised in the cocktail world after this."

The fruit balances the bitterness of the Negroni; use your preferred Negroni proportions. With muddled fruit I just shake rather than stir, and I strain as usual; fine straining is overly fussy for a drink that ain't a martini to begin with. This is a template that can be used with other fruits and with White Negronis as well, e.g., a White Peach Negroni. Experiment to match ingredient brands/styles to fruits."

It might be nice to experiment with 20 ml Poire William, if folks want a more forward pear taste. The mixologist was impressed with the concoction, too!"

This is a Margarita which truly needs a vegetal, mineral and/or citrus-y additive free Blanco Tequila. I opened my Cascahuin Blanco and tried this first, and it was really good, with it being balanced towards the very tart side."

This was off the charts for me. It is simple, and bright and clean in flavour. Nicely sour as if you have taken a shot of tequila with a taste of lime. I will definitely have this one again. We did add Difford's Margarita Bitters which nicely embellished a wonderful cocktail."

Maybe go all in on the smoke and switch to 1.5 tequila/0.5 mezcal?"

Almost too much liquid for a coupe so might need to figure out how to adjust all ingredients appropriately. Definitely worth playing around with the ratio on this one though."

San Pellegrino Pompelmo in the shaker tin, knowing it's not as carbonated as most sodas it would probably be ok. I served it over recycled leftover ice from making other cocktails that I rinse off and put back in a freezer bag. Doing this made it a 5 star cocktail for me, having concentrated flavors while still being able to dilute it to my liking with a few stirs."

Still a bit sweet, but would make again, but may omit the syrup (keeping the Goldschlager). Really liked as you can taste the rum which is not the case in many tiki drinks. Was originally drawn to this cocktail based on its name. Definitely on my favourites."

The Bourbon was prevalent upfront, but it was followed by a great citrus/sweet balance and finishing with a hint of the Orgeat. Highly recommend. I made a second one right after with a barrel proof rye whiskey, and though I like the extra \"spiciness\" the Rye brings, I agree with you Simon, I prefer the Bourbon version."

While making it to Jamie's proportions came up a half ounce short squeezing a rather dry Cara Cara orange and made up the difference with Ocean Spray white grapefruit juice (what a variable beast orange juice can be). Frankly the results tasted weird. Tried a dash of Chartreuse Vegetal Elixer which added complexity but still tasted weird. Then added a dash of Hella ginger bitters and miraculously the weirdness was vanquished."

This is likely my favorite dry martini variant - I have Cocchi Americano Blanco and Lillet Blanco, and I prefer the Cocchi to the Lillet so I used that for the \"vermouth\". I also find the volume of the cocktail too much, so I scale it down. That said, when I'm in the mood for a dry martini - this is my favorite."

If not balanced the cocktail can taste like medicine.\nFor your mint liqueur, be careful not to let the mint steep too long or the bitterness of the leaves will leech out into the vodka. Also the quality of the vodka is key. A cheap vodka will yield a cheap tasting liqueur. I have given up on tying to make my own. When purchasing price does make a difference. I have found the cheaper the sweeter and more artificial the flavour."

Also, I would prefer to just churn with the crushed ice as is sometimes suggested as this seems like over-dilution"

Galliano\n3/4 oz. lime juice\nand it was superbly balanced! Not too sweet at all, a sort of Rum Sour! Found that recipe when googling \"cocktails to go with seafood.\" And, yes, it makes a great accompaniment to either an elaborate or very simple seafood dinner, lunch, or canape."

It\u2019s very pleasant, balanced not sweet or dry, can just about make out the grand marnier behind the absinthe.

The ingredients total 105ml plus 36% dilution from shaking with ice = 143ml. A 7-oz coupe glass has a capacity of 200ml to the rim, so it would be 70% (roughly 2/3rds) full. If you are not achieving roughly this capacity, then perhaps your ice needs to be left to temper, and/or a more vigorous shake is required."

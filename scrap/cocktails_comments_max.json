Really liked the interplay of flavors a lot but felt it needed a little more of what was making it good. Increased the lemon juice a bit to 1/3 oz and the St.-Germain to 1/2 oz (same as the Drambuie). The fruit juices, the acidity, and the combination of Drambuie and elderflower liqueur makes for a cocktail that acknowledges its lineage to but is differentiated from the Rusty Nail.

No Pallini so used Bellini limoncello liqueur, figuring that was close enough. Lemons from Albertson\u2019s, not Amalfi. Added a couple lemon twists to the shaker and garnished with lemon zest to be sure it was lemony enough. It was. Excellent!"

I understand why you do this kind of thing, and you do it continually, but your recipes would be tried more if you offered substitutes or how-to-make-ersatz-versions of uncommon ingredients. That way, if I liked the jury-rigged version, I'd be much more likely to go for the real thing - and Giffards would sell more. As it is, this recipe prompted me to make an Old Fashioned, period."

In my case the lime citrus and rum were the predominant flavors with the apricot brandy not being noticeable."

I may add a little more grapefruit in its next iteration as our grapefruit are very sweet or add a splash more dry gin. 10 out of 10 on the quaffometer. We named it \"Here's to Wendell\" after our recently departed dog..."

No curacao so used de Fussigny orange cognac liqueur, which is nice & orangey. I recently got Drillaud's Pomegranate liqueur and find it a superior alternative to grenadine since it adds richness and flavor, not just additional sugar. And I don't care if Vic called for it but the sugar syrup is completely unnecessary. No cartridge glasses so served in tiki mugs rather than Collins glasses."

The Bourbon was more prevalent at that ratio.\nFor those commenting that it was too minty, a \"julep\" has mint as a predominant flavor. Something you can try, instead of muddling the mint leaves, is to just add them to the shaker without muddling. As you are shaking the cocktail, the ice will bruise the mint leaves just enough to give the cocktail a more subtle mint flavor."

It is a bit less bitter, the orange stands out better, also the color is pink and fun. Depending on the triple sec this can be a less sweet, less bitter, more citrusy alternative to Negroni. Probably won't replace it in your repertoire but can find its way as a variation so we don't get bored."

Drain off the water, the idea is the ice should only be coated in bitters and not have any liquid bitters in the bottom, then start adding the ingredients one at a time then stir, topping up with fresh ice throughout, storing for 90 seconds before adding each ingredient. Water from the ice as you stir is essential."

Use a softer, less bold vermouth like Dolin and the whiskey comes through even stronger. Serving it up only accentuates the booziness.\n\nHence I suggest upping the vermouth, or lessening the whiskey, or both, and perhaps try it on-the-rocks (my grandfather's personal favorite drink, I know where my taste comes from!). Difford's \"High Ryeser\" recipe is more suited to my taste and works great on ice too.\n\nIf you like whiskey a lot more than you like vermouth, 2:1 is probably perfect. I love vermouth though..."

The only reason it\u2019s a treat cocktail is because the ingredients (Calvados, G Chartreuse) are very expensive here in Canada.\n\nIf you enjoy a Last Word, try it.

I used my standard Negroni picks (Tanqueray, Campari, and Cinzano), with the addition of Aperol, and the result is pleasingly subtle but still carries the sublimity of a good Negroni. I suspect this would be a great spec for a more delicate, less juniper-forward gin that might be overshadowed by an equal-parts Campari blend."

The agave and the acidity of the fortified wine give the cocktail some much needed freshness to balance the floral honey notes and warm spice notes of the coffee liquer."

Talisker is a bit on the milder side of smoke and its more maritime qualities sat well with the gin. The addition of bianco vermouth rounded it off. I second Jason's comment you need a gin with a strong presence to balance the peat. Unbelievable how such a small amount of peat can contribute so much."

Will definitely make again. I do agree that it's better served down with orange bitters."

White rum doesn't stand up to the red ingredients as well as gin does. Using a higher ratio of vermouth to Campari improves the Negroni when making it with Campari as the bitter red, though; I may try this with other Valentino/Negroni recipes."

You have to try this. The bitterness can be an acquired taste but you can work up starting with an Enzoni Cocktail (vermouth replaced with lemon juice, sugar and some muddled grapes) or the simplicity of a Garibaldi (orange juice + Campari).\n\nSpeaking of rum, the Jungle Bird also mixes Campari with pineapple juice, lime and dark rum."

It's more complex than a G&T, though, with the fruit notes thrown in the mix."

Per D. Kavrakov I gave it a dash of Bitter Truth Aromatic Bitters, which complemented the Averna nicely. The Averna makes it heavier and richer and more complex than a conventional Campari-based Negroni so I garnished with lemon zest instead of orange for contrast. Very good Negroni variant."

Whiskey-barrel-finished reds are pretty commonplace (but not all are equal) among many brands and varietals, but definitely experiment!

The applejack doesn't play a leading role in the flavor, but does help keep the cocktail light and a bit fruity - preventing overwhelming aquavit flavors. And the sweet vermouth is surprisingly demure - I'm sure it helps with the sweetness and color, and the overall fruitiness, but flavor notes are far behind the lead of the aquavit and chartreuse."

I might try playing with the ratio of aquavit to brandy, and see if I can adjust them to my taste."

I prefer bitter and dry drinks, so I enjoyed it, nonetheless."

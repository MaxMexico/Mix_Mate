The drink works incredibly well, with so much wonderful balanced fruitiness and sweetness, off-set by the botanicals of the gin adding backbone and balance. Not mind-blowing, definitely worthy of the 4 stars, maybe nudging to 4.25?"

Although my grenadine is not a vivid as commercial syrup there is only 15/110 ml of red ingredients here so I think there is a mistake with the picture. That said, the drink was lovely: light, creamy, mild gin. The 5 & 5 scores are bang on. Will certainly be having this one again."

Go for a young rum, the indication here of 6-8 years is pretty good. And I recommend, really try it with the Havana Club 7 anos. Dave Brooms's recommends it for mixing with ginger beer in \"Rum. The Manual\" and he es right."

The next time I try it I'll try reducing the mezcal a touch, as it is more domineering than I'd like, but perhaps by not as much as 15mls. Maybe another couple of dashes of absinthe, too."

It is light and sweet, with enough bitterness to suit an aperitivo. It Is colorful and easy to replicate.

I don't know if it's as effective as the foil, but it seemed to work. My snifter was also too big for the lid, so some smoke may have escaped... Like John suggested, the drink stands on its own without the smoke, but the smoke definitely adds a pleasant perfumy accent."

Here is my trick for the cinnamon smoke: place the powder on a small piece of aluminum foil, put the glass upside down over the cinnamon, and wrap the foil tightly around the glass. Then lift the glass, the foil with the cinnamon down, and heat the foil for a few seconds with a kitchen burner (like for cr√®me br√ªl√©e). Thus, the cinnamon doesn‚Äôt fly away und the smoke is trapped in the glass until the liquid is mixed. Remove the glass, cover it with something‚Ä¶"

At that point, it's a good - not great - cocktail. But all the same, an interesting one to try if only for it's eclectic composition."

The remark about this cocktail potentially having a 'misleading' name is definitely true, for, like other user-submitted comments here, the banana element is actually quite subtle. Might work much better holistically if my expectations of this drink was that it was an aperitif, rather than, as the name suggests, some kind of dessert/digestif. Will try again with 30ml Tempus Fugit though."

For me, this is a definite improvement as I am quite fond of banana, but at this ratio you start to get some of the underlying silverey mouthfeel of the liqueur which some people may not like, and may be somewhat un-daiquiri-esque.

I personally was not hoping for a banana-forward/sweet banana drink here; I love the plain Daiquiri and definitely wanted a Daiquiri first with banana undertones second, but the banana here was barely (if at all) detectable.\n\nFor me increasing the Banane du Bresil from 2/3oz/20ml to 1oz/30ml did the trick. I personally think with this the drink is identifiably and very pleasantly banana-tasting but without overwhelming the core of the Daiquiri or becoming very sweet.\n\nThe Giffard Banane du Bresil is magnificent (it actually smells and tastes richly of bananas, not artificial banana-sweet flavour) but I wonder if the proportion suggested is more suitable for lower grade/artificially flavoured and bright yellow banana liqueurs which I suspect might be more prone to overpowering the lovely rum and citrus? I have some Bols Banana liqueur lying around (very potent 'foam banana sweet' smell/taste) and should endeavour to test this theory."

L'Aero D'Or sounds like it has more orange-y flavors so I upped the Curacao to 1 tsp and used Angostura Orange bitters. Not too sweet and plenty of interesting flavors going on. My wife agrees that this one is a winner."

This was a great drink regardless, with a distinct evolution from bitter grapefruit to herbal tequila to sherry salinity. It's complex and well balanced and overall delightful."

Here I am, another spring, another Bending Blades... and now I can't imagine it without that Suzean slap. So I'm definitely sticking to the original 15ml, but I hope others will try it either way and add another favourite cocktail to their cabinets!"

Cynar is popular right now, but it's the wrong Amaro for this balance. Averna is much better. And as for a garnish, I'm partial to an orange twist, which brings in a citrus bitter that adds so much more than cherry sweetness. So, my recipe is: 2 oz rye, 1 oz Cocchi Americano, 1/3 oz (2 tsp) Maraschino Liqueur, 1/6 oz (1 tsp) Averna. Stir, orange twist."

Used Elixir's Ver green herbal liqueur (Oregon's finest) instead of Chartreuse and it was more than sufficiently complex and bitter. A lemon twist played to the herbal aspects probably better than orange, and there isn't orange in this version of the Bijou anyway. To be savored slowly, as the ice melts."

Really lets the Jager notes shine without being too overwhelming (I haven't had a lot of Jager yet, but this one really made the 'cola' notes noticeable). Less than 1 standard drink, too, so a nice, interesting option if looking for something that's not too strong."

I did, however, then try this with 60 ml of Junipero Gin, and it's better, but I'm still contemplating a blend, only to knock down the intense herbal notes of the Junipero and Noilly Prat dry... Why is the Martini so bland yet so fascinating? (6 Oct 2022, 3:36p)"

The reduced cream of coconut is what attracted me to this recipe, because I used homemade cream of coconut, and the process of making my own let me know exactly how much sugar is in that stuff. The result was very pleasant. Of course, the most important quality of any blue curacao drink is that it should be blue, but this one is also pretty tasty. It packs a little bit of a punch though, with 45ml of rum and 40ml blue curacao."

The orange twist introduces a fresh fruity nose. The Bourbon then comes through, tempered by sweetness and botanicals of the bitters. Fantastic drink. I am glad to have remade the Demerara syrup and the drink itself!"

I think I‚Äôve nailed the recipe to my taste. When I saw this version, I was intrigued. Now that I have made it, I think it‚Äôs a very good drink. I tweaked the recipe somewhat to match my formula for the CR2. I used Cocchi Americano instead of the Lillet Blanc, and three sprays of the absinthe. Muy delicioso, y peligroso!"

As is my style, I started experimenting before the cocktail was actually consumed. Inspired by Kris Byers' reference to margaritas, I started thinking. Margaritas come in infinite varieties -- just add a flavor. So Cadaver Reviver #2 had the addition of 1/2 shot of Whidbey Island Distillery's Loganberry Liquor. Thumbs up (to the cocktail and Whidbey Island Distillery)."

In the original recipe the Riesling replaces the vermouth, and the proportions served in Rome in the 1950s was: 3 parts dry gin, 2 parts Mosel Riesling, 1 part Campari. Doing a bit of research on Mosel wine production in the 1950s, it is very likely the wine was dry. With the technology available at the time, most wines would end up dry by default, as the sugars would continue the fermentation process until there was no or very little sugar left."

(Supposedly the Selvarey White was created by the former Director of Research and Development of the Cuban rum industry overseeing Havana Club prior to 1994)). The rum was not lost for me, and I could taste each component with them all very well-balanced. Probably one of my favorite pineapple drinks so far with the Falernum really making things interesting."
